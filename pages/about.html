                    <span class="para-start">Amelie Brooks-Hochheimer</span> is a writer/director/producer/community builder 
                    living in Brooklyn. A graduate of the Rita & Burton Goldberg Department of 
                    Dramatic Writing, Amelie has spent the past three years co-founding production 
                    company Fat Bitch Media with her bestie and general badass Pinky Mancuso, for 
                    which Amelie has thus far produced, written, and co-creative directed three 
                    photoshoots, an original zine, and full length play Gathering. In addition to 
                    her own ventures, Amelie has produced several other endeavors, including 
                    International Puerto Rican Heritage Fest/Out On Film Fest short film selection 
                    Heels (2023), and Iconic America: Our Symbols and Stories with David Rubenstein 
                    for PBS. She is currently producing two upcoming short films for besties 
                    Jay-Michael Wilson and Olivia Capestany. In her free time Amelie enjoys hanging 
                    out with her three legged cat, eating good, and running away to the ocean.

                    <h2>Writing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Amelie has been dreaming up new worlds since before she can remember, including 
                        an iconic stint in which she read the entire Hunger Games trilogy in one weekend 
                        and then wrote her own trilogy of novels that was unfortunately basically just 
                        the Hunger Games but with different characters. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Currently, she is working on revisions of her first produced play Gathering 
                    (Makers’ Space, 2024) and polishing up her second play mom play which will have 
                    a staged reading in early 2026. She is an enthusiastic attempter at blogging 
                    (read her Substack here) and a semi-shabby poet. She dreams one day of getting 
                    paid a living wage to write full time, but we’ll see.

                        Amelie is passionate about helping people turn their dreams into reality. If 
                        you have a seemingly-impossible idea, something really out there, or if you’re 
                        enthusiastic about expanding the scope of work that is given resources and 
                        funding, hit her up and she will get you together.
